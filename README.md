Playing around with the qt5 framework and TravisCI

## Health
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/saschascherrer/qt5playground.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/saschascherrer/qt5playground)

## Aims of this project
This project aims at exploring and testing out some parts of the ecosystem of 
github.com (like TravisCI) and to gather experience and gain knowledge in regards
to how automated (unit) testing is done in a qt5 application.

This project is in no ways meant to provide any useful software but could maybe help
fellow programmers to setup their own automation workflow.
